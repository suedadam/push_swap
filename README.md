# push_swap
42 Project - Through this project, you will have to sort a stack with a limit number of instructions, in as few moves as possible. To succeed, you'll need to use various sorting algorithms and choose the solution(s) most appropriate for a highly optimized data sorting.

## What this project does?
This project is pretty simple, we're thrown into an environment where we're supposed to be taught sorting algorithms (or so we think).
Through the process you quickly realize that your sorting algorithm isn't going to work so instead you can do whichever sorting algorithm you
wish in your backend and then making a new algorithm to make the least amount of operations to go from one position to the next. 

## How did I go about this project?
I made an algorithm to detect the least amount of moves to put it in the correct order for each piece from stack_a -> stack_b.
I do this for reverse and normal rotations, from this I then also have an ammoritzation function which bulks them together when possible.
(I would upload my notes; however, I use a [Boogie Board](http://myboogieboard.com/)
